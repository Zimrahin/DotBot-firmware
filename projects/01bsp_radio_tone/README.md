# Radio TX Board Support Package Usage Example

Load this app onto an nRF board to transmit a sine wave (tone) using the settings specified in the `conf.h` file. 

This app works with `01bsp_radio_tx` to test signal blocking and with `01bsp_radio_rx.c` to receive packets, which are then parsed via serial communication to a computer.
