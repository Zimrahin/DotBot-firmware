# IEEE 802.15.4 Radio TX-RX Board Support Package Usage Example

Loading this app onto an nRF board enables communication using the IEEE 802.15.4 radio. It prints packets received via interrupts and sends a packet every 100 ms.

You can test this code by loading the firmware onto two nRF DKs, with one DK in Debug mode to print the received packets.
